# Code Refactoring

A code refactoring excercise challenge for class. In this repo I attempted to consolidate code and make it look neater with keeping the way it appears. This was a good learning opportunity on how to code and how the grading process is for bootcamp.

Help from Tyler (kinda)
Notes from bootcamp helped me realize I had to change all the class elements to like the <div>s to sections to make everything neater.
